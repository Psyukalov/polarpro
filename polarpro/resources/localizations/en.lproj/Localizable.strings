Enter the FPS (Frames Per Second) you are shooting with. The app is going to help you calculate how to get shutter speed to double frame rate. Example: Your frame rate is 30, the app will tell you how to get your shutter to 1/60th.\n2. Enter your ISO. ISO is part of the exposure triangle; make sure ISO stays the same. (It can occasionally fluctuate in Auto exposure mode)\n3. Enter the Shutter Speed the camera is currently shooting at. This number can be found on your DJI app.\n4. If there is a filter installed on your camera, enter it in the filter-installed field. The app needs this information to calculate properly.";
"tips_description" = "1. When shooting in auto mode, remember that ISO, Aperture, and Shutter can change mid-flight. If you are shooting in Auto Mode you just need to get shutter close to double frame rate, because it will swing.\n2. When shooting in Manual Mode, Set your Aperture, ISO, and Frame Rate on your camera. Now enter the shutter speed the camera is firing at to properly expose the scene. The app will calculate which filter is needed to get shutter speed at double frame rate, with a balanced exposure. Install the recommended filter. Now change shutter speed to double frame rate on your camera.\nNote: Use the EV comp wheel to balance exposure if under a full F-Stop.";
"faq_description" = "Why is it not recommending a filter?\nIf no filter is being recommended it means shutter speed is lower than double frame rate.\nWhat about Aperture?\nJust Make sure Aperture does not change between using the calculator and filming. This must be held constant.";
